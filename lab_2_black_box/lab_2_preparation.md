# Assignment 2: Triangle Test

## Specification
Triangle. The main function takes 3 positive whole-number lengths to be typed in as command line arguments. The program responds with a description of the triangle, as follows:
- <b>equilateral</b> - if all three sides have equal length
- <b>isosceles</b> - if two sides have equal length
- <b>right-angled</b> - if one angle is a right angle
- <b>scalene</b> - all sides different lengths, no right angles
- <b>impossible</b> - if the given side lengths do not form a triangle

Area and perimeter of the triangle are calculated, too.

## Output

### One set of equivalence classes covering valid and invalid cases

Equivalence Class Partioning: Split input/output into classes which the software handles equivalently.â€¢Select test cases to represent each class.
